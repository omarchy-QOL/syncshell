# Changelog

Notable changes to Syncthing for Omarchy are documented here.

## Unreleased

- resume file activity when Syncthing's event sequence resets on reconnect
  while preserving unread events from a surviving daemon
- match Syncthing home and config directory options consistently so service
  controls cannot target another instance through short option spellings
- replace the QML Syncthing engine with one parent-bound native Go core while
  preserving the complete Omarchy panel and settings workflow
- fix issue 45 by treating healthy external Syncthing instances as online
  without exposing controls for an unrelated inactive user service
- bundle one reproducible static Linux x86_64 executable with a public JSONL
  protocol and keep credentials, REST, events, lifecycle, and mutations in Go
- make accepted single and global rescans visible immediately with rotating,
  inert controls and explicit optimistic folder state
- keep long-running accepted rescans from surfacing a false request timeout
- wait until targeted folders leave scanning before reporting rescan
  completion, so notices and the all-folders control follow the last folder
  rather than the HTTP accept
- show the bar sync overlay as soon as a plugin rescan is busy, not only
  after snapshot scanning arrives
- distinguish plain `SCANNING` from concurrent `SCAN+SYNC` during an accepted
  rescan
- require a shell restart after updating to load the current plugin while
  preserving settings and bar placement

## 0.1.7 - 2026-08-31

- reconcile configured and systemd user-service startup states without changing
  the independent runtime start and stop controls (thanks @renews for reporting)
- add a configurable interval for detecting external systemd state changes
- add per-folder and all-folder rescans, a clearer host ID copy control, and
  remembered local host identity while Syncthing is stopped

## 0.1.6 - 2026-08-22

- Make live and indexed file activity accurate for additions, deletions,
  concurrent changes, and active folders.
- Refine folder management with pending offers, copyable Syncthing IDs, and
  explicit link, unlink, and forget actions.
- Add versioned icon preferences, live Omarchy Web UI theming, and clean plugin
  removal that can preserve settings.
- Refresh the preview and add four focused demo videos.

## 0.1.5 - 2026-08-20

  the default (@davidszp, @ilyaZar).
