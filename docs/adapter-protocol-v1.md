# Syncshell adapter protocol v1

Protocol v1 is the only native-core wire contract in Syncshell 0.1.8. One rich
host owns one child, one session, one event cursor, and one serialized mutation
queue.

## Transport

- UTF-8 JSON Lines travel over the child's standard input and output.
- Each line is one JSON object and is at most 8,388,608 bytes including its
  newline.
- Standard output contains protocol lines only.
- Standard error contains bounded, sanitized diagnostics only.
- The API key never appears in arguments, JSONL, errors, logs, fixtures,
  settings, or screenshots.
- The host terminates the child when its service is destroyed. Closing standard
  input requests a graceful end.
- Protocol major `1` is required. There is no negotiation, patch format, second
  output format, daemon, socket, or client brokerage.

## Core messages

The first accepted output is `hello`:

```json
{"v":1,"type":"hello","build":{"version":"0.1.8"},"capabilities":[]}
```

State is always a complete snapshot. Revisions increase only when public state
changes, and a host replaces state only with a higher revision:

```json
{"v":1,"type":"snapshot","revision":1,"state":{}}
```

The `state` value serializes the session's public snapshot directly. It contains
host-neutral connection, identity, device, folder, pending-offer, activity,
mutation, Web UI, lifecycle, executable, and capability facts. It never
contains Omarchy labels, layout, settings paths, icon style, Web UI theme
preference, package-manager state, or other presentation policy.

The complete state object contains these sections:

- `hostId`: the bounded adapter identity supplied at startup
- `connection`: endpoint, health, authorization, online, and freshness
- `identity`: authenticated device ID and Syncthing version
- `devices`: bounded configured devices and connection state
- `folders`: bounded configuration, status, sharing, and current errors
- `pendingFolders`: bounded current offers and encryption flags
- `activity`: bounded active files and the session-owned rotating current file
- `webUi`: openable URL, selected theme, and GUI-assets path
- `installation`: host-neutral executable presence and path
- `mutation`: the one serialized action's busy, error, and result state
- `counts`: normalized folder, device, connection, problem, and syncing totals
- `truncation`: explicit counts for collection and folder-error entries omitted
  by safety bounds
- `lifecycle`: exact binding, observation, classification, and capabilities
- `capabilities`: the action names implemented by this core

Every collection and remote string is bounded so the complete snapshot remains
within the transport line limit. The limits cover up to 128 folders, 256
devices, and 64 sharing relationships per folder. Any omitted entries are
reported through `truncation` so a host can direct the user to the Web UI. A
fresh snapshot replaces the prior state; no section is a patch or independently
revisioned cache.

Every accepted request has a non-empty caller-generated string `id` and exactly
one result:

```json
{"v":1,"type":"refresh","id":"7"}
{"v":1,"type":"configure","id":"8","config":{}}
{"v":1,"type":"action","id":"9","action":"folder.rescan","args":{}}
{"v":1,"type":"result","id":"9","ok":true,"revision":2,"data":{}}
```

A failed result has a stable machine code and sanitized text:

```json
{"v":1,"type":"result","id":"9","ok":false,"error":{"code":"folder_missing","message":"folder is no longer configured"}}
```

The one `configure` request may update `probeIntervalSeconds`,
`refreshIntervalSeconds`, and `desiredServiceState`. They are validated and
applied in memory. Lifecycle probes are lightweight and independent from the
low-frequency authoritative refresh. Configuration cannot carry credentials,
settings paths, style values, or arbitrary host objects.

The domain action names are:

- `folder.pause`
- `folder.resume`
- `folder.recheck-errors`
- `folder.rescan`
- `folder.rescan-all`
- `folder.forget`
- `folder.add-existing`
- `folder.suggest-id`
- `lifecycle.start`
- `lifecycle.stop`
- `lifecycle.enable`
- `lifecycle.disable`
- `webui.set-theme`
- `webui.open` (Omarchy desktop capability only)

Unsupported names fail; they do not fall back or alias another action.

Action arguments are exact:

- `folder.pause`, `folder.resume`, `folder.rescan`, and `folder.forget` take
  `folderId`.
- `folder.recheck-errors`, `folder.rescan-all`, `folder.suggest-id`, and
  lifecycle actions take an empty object. Rechecking errors rescans only active
  folders with a currently reported problem before publishing fresh state. A
  global rescan requires at least one linked folder and asks Syncthing to scan
  all linked folders.
- `folder.add-existing` takes `folderId`, `path`, optional `label`, bounded
  `deviceIds`, and optional `pendingDeviceId`.
- `webui.set-theme` takes `theme`.
- `webui.open` takes no arguments. It launches the selected GUI with a private
  desktop grant; the result and snapshots contain no grant.

Successful folder-ID suggestion and add results return the resulting
`folderId` in `data`. Irrelevant fields are rejected rather than ignored.

## Termination and protocol failure

A host may send a correlated `shutdown` request. The core stops accepting new
actions, cancels its long poll, completes or cancels the active mutation, emits
the result, then emits `end` and exits:

```json
{"v":1,"type":"shutdown","id":"10"}
{"v":1,"type":"result","id":"10","ok":true}
{"v":1,"type":"end","reason":"shutdown"}
```

An unrecoverable framing or version error emits one `fatal` line when output is
still safe, then exits nonzero:

```json
{"v":1,"type":"fatal","code":"protocol_version","message":"protocol major 1 required"}
```

Malformed, recent duplicate, oversized, or post-shutdown requests never invoke
an action. Completed request IDs are remembered in a bounded rolling window;
the window never imposes a process lifetime. A crash is process state owned by
the host adapter; it is not represented as Syncthing offline.
