## Syncthing status icons

The four SVG files in this directory are formatting adaptations of Syncthing's
official 16-by-16 status icons. Their appearance and view boxes are preserved:

- `status-default.svg`
- `status-notify.svg`
- `status-pause.svg`
- `status-sync.svg`

They were retrieved from the Syncthing repository at commit
`058bcd7334839663cf569501d3ac539034d45cb5`:

<https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/tree/058bcd7334839663cf569501d3ac539034d45cb5/assets/statusicons>

`mono/` holds monochrome redraws of the same four icons, tinted to the theme at
runtime by `MonoIcon.qml`. They must stay pure white on transparent: the tint
multiplies the source's value channel, so anything darker comes out darker
still.
