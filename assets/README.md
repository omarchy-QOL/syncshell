# Assets

## Marketplace preview

`../preview.png` is intentionally the only published asset outside this
directory. The Omarchy plugin marketplace discovers a preview only when it uses
a supported `preview.*` name in the repository root. `manifest.json` has no
preview path field.

## Published demos

`published/` contains the four release videos linked from the root README. Each
MP4 has a matching PNG thumbnail:

- `01_syncthing_file_activity`
- `02_syncthing_folder_lifecycle`
- `03_syncthing_theme_aware_webUI`
- `04_syncthing_icon_change_and_other_settings`

The ignored capture harness, upstream reference, and byte-identical release
backups live in `../docs/interactive/syncthing-demo/`. The ignored project
skill at `../.agents/skills/syncthing-demo-video/` documents the reproduction
workflow.

## Syncthing status icons

The four SVG files in this directory are formatting adaptations of Syncthing's
official 16-by-16 status icons. Their appearance and view boxes are preserved:

- `status-default.svg`
- `status-notify.svg`
- `status-pause.svg`
- `status-sync.svg`

They were retrieved from the Syncthing repository at commit
`058bcd7334839663cf569501d3ac539034d45cb5`:

<https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/tree/058bcd7334839663cf569501d3ac539034d45cb5/assets/statusicons>

`mono/` holds monochrome redraws of the same four icons, tinted to the theme at
runtime by `MonoIcon.qml`. They must stay pure white on transparent: the tint
multiplies the source's value channel, so anything darker comes out darker
still.
